    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines a mechanism to define auxiliary syntax keywords
      independently in different modules that still have the same binding so
      that they can be used interchangedly as literal identifiers
      in <code>syntax-rules</code> and <code>syntax-case</code> expressions and
      can be both imported under the same name without conflicts.
    </p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>The sample Chibi-Scheme implementation is yet a work in progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>
      Literal identifiers in <code>syntax-rules</code>
      and <code>syntax-case</code> expressions match another
      identifier if and only if both identifiers have the same lexical
      binding or if both identifiers are the same and both have no
      lexical binding.  This equivalence relation is the same as the
      one defined by <code>free-identifier=?</code> from R4RS and
      R6RS.
    </p>

    <p>
      Macro writers that need these literal identifiers as part of
      specific surrounding forms have therefore two choices.  Either
      they match against a bound or against an unbound identifier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Matching against an unbounded identifier is problematic because
      an unbounded identifier cannot be renamed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, as in the derived forms defined in R6RS and R7RS, the
      literal identifiers are therefore bound.  Their bindings are
      called auxiliary syntax in R6RS and R7RS.  They are bound to a
      unique transformer for that syntax.  In other words, two
      identifiers naming auxiliary syntax match
      (are <code>free-identifier=?</code>) if and only if they are
      bound to the same transformer.
    </p>

    <p>
      This has a different kind of problem.  Often, the names for
      auxiliary syntax are either short common words
      (like <em>else</em>) or simple symbolic identifiers
      (like <em>=&gt;</em>).  Therefore, independent libraries may
      each export an auxiliary keyword but all with the same name.  This is
      problematic when the bindings are not mutually the same (that
      is, the identifiers are not <code>free-identifier=?</code>).
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines therefore a mechanism for independent
      libraries to independently export auxiliary syntax that have
      mutually the same bindings.
    </p>

    <p>
      If syntax parameters are supported, this auxiliary syntax is a
      syntax parameter so that it can be hygienically be rebound
      through <code>syntax-parameterize</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI also defines a facility to define auxiliary syntax in
      the above sense lexically locally.  This can be used to bring
      back auxiliary syntax back into scope and can be interesting for
      macro writers.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the mailing list
      to <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-177/srfi-177.html">SRFI
      177</a>, the idea of hygienic keywords (where keywords are
      understood in the sense of SRFI 177) has been discussed.
      Arguments in favor of hygienic keywords were the avoidance of
      any runtime overhead and that they bring in all the advantages
      of the usual Scheme macro hygiene.  One argument against
      hygienic keywords was that independent libraries may want to
      independently export hygienic keywords under the same name
      without conflicts.  That is now possible with this SRFI.
    </p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <h3>Syntax</h3>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines one syntax binding
      form, <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code>.
    </p>

    <p><code>(define-auxiliary-syntax〈keyword〉〈symbol〉)</code></p>

    <p>
      This form is a definition that can be used wherever syntax
      definitions are allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>〈keyword〉</code> is
      bound to (auxiliary) syntax named by <code>〈symbol〉</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <code>〈keyword〉</code> bound
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> has the same
      binding as another identifier (that is, they
      are <code>free-identifier=?</code>) if and only if the other
      identifier is also bound
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> and with the same
      name.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a Scheme supporting syntax parameters
      (see <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-139/srfi-139.html">SRFI
	139</a>), the auxiliary syntax are syntax parameters.
    </p>

    <h3>Libraries</h3>

    <p>
      This SRFI defines two libraries, <code>(srfi 206)</code>
      and <code>(srfi 206 *)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> keyword is (the sole
      identifier) exported by the library <code>(srfi 206)</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The library <code>(srfi 206 *)</code> is a (magic) library that
      can, in import sets, only be referenced in the form <code>(only
      (srfi 206 *) 〈identifier〉…)</code>.  This import set imports
      the <code>〈identifier〉</code>s, each bound at top-level as if
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> to auxiliary syntax
      with the respective name.
    </p>

    <h3>Interoperability</h3>

    <p>
      In a Scheme implementation supporting this SRFI, all auxiliary
      syntax, in particular the
      identifiers <code>else</code>, <code>=&gt;</code>, <code>unquote</code>,
      <code>unquote-splicing</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>...</code>
      defined in <code>(scheme base)</code> behave as if defined
      through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code> with their
      respective names.
    </p>

    <p>
      Syntax parameters that have no sensible initial binding
      (like <code>yield</code>
      of <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-190/srfi-190.html">SRFI
	190</a>) shall be bound through <code>define-auxiliary-syntax</code>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

    <p>This SRFI cannot be implemented portably in R6RS or R7RS
      alone.  A sample implementation for Chibi-Scheme will be provided.
    </p>

    <p>
      In
      the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8f6/d3b704b0ec83d9803377fdb88996853813b1.pdf">original
      syntax model of the syntax-case expander by R. Kent Dybvig et
      al.</a> two bound identifiers are <code>free-identifier=?</code>
      if and only if their associated labels are the same.  An
      implementation following this model thus has to maintain a
      (weak) hash-table mapping (symbolic) names to labels.  Whenever
      auxiliary syntax with some name is defined the associated label
      is looked up or, if it does not exist yet, created on the fly.
      In a given environment, these labels resolve to suitable
      transformers.
